    \caption{The empirical cumulative distribution function for both the Stage IV observations (black) and the NSSL-WRF forecasts (red), derived over the time period 01 April 2007 -- 31 March 2010.
    The vertical black dotted line is the \mbox{25.4 mm} threshold.
    The horizontal blue dotted line is the Stage IV quantile associated with the \mbox{25.4 mm} threshold.
    Where the blue dotted line intersects the NSSL-WRF empirical cumulative distribution function is the corresponding NSSL-WRF threshold at which the ratio of points above to points below is equal to the Stage IV ratio of points above to points below the \mbox{25.4 mm} threshold.
    This new threshold for the NSSL-WRF is \mbox{26.625 mm}.}

    \caption{The two-dimensional frequency distribution of stage IV observations greater than or equal to \mbox{25.4 mm} relative to NSSL-WRF forecasts of similar events for the training dataset (1 Apr 2007 -- 31 Mar 2010).
    The representative NSSL-WRF forecast grid point is marked by a white dot in the middle of the domain and the stage IV observation frequency is color filled.
    To illustrate the displacement between forecasts and observations, the centroid of the observations is denoted by the black dot.
    Contour labels are given in hundred-thousands.}

    \caption{Example forecasts and observations from two separate days and differing forecast lengths.
    The column on the left depicts forecasts and observations for the 6-hrs ending 02 May 2010 at 18 UTC (12-18 hr forecast) whereas the column on the right depicts forecasts and observations for the 6-hrs ending 27 September 2010 at 00 UTC (18-24 hr forecast).
    Panels (a) and (b) denote the Stage IV 6-hr quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE), panels (c) and (d) denote the 6-hr NSSL-WRF 6-hr quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPF), and panels (e) and (f) depict the Stage IV QPE greater than 25.4 mm contoured on top of the NSSL-WRF probability of exceeding 25.4 mm in 6-hrs. The minimum shaded probability is 0.0001 (0.01\%).}
