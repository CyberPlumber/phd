1. Sample forecasts at the 12.7 mm threshold
1. 16 panel: 15 ensemble member QPFs & STG4
1. 16 panel: 15 ensemble member probabilistic forecasts & Mean all with STG4 threshold overlaid


### Figures to Modify

2. ROC and Reliability Diagram Code (add counts to Reliability) at 12.7 mm
2. ROC and Reliability Diagram Code (add counts to Reliability) at 25.4 mm
